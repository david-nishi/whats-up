# Hey Kevin!

Check out src/index.js, then come back here.

## The Challenge
- What does this code do?

## Stretch Goals
- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your fork to your local machine.
- Use the `node` command in a terminal of your choice to run this code.
- Make some changes to the code in your local machine, check if they work, and commit those changes with `git`.
- Push those changes back up to your GitHub account.
- In GitHub, open a pull request with your changes from your fork to this repo's `kevin` branch. Document the changes you made.

## Notes
- All of this is hard, if you've not seen it before.
- All of this is industry standard.
- All of these steps have instructions somewhere online.
- You can treat me as a co-worker, and ask for help as much as you feel is appropriate.
- As a professional, you will often recieve instructions full of words you've never seen before and problems you have no idea how to solve, but your job is to solve them anyway. If you can work your way through all the stretch goals, that will give you some understanding of what all that feels like.
